1.	What attracted you to this career path? 
I started my career in information systems auditing. As an auditor, you are required to assess the security controls that have been exist in information systems that have been deployed in an organization. You are also play the role of an independent advisor to the management of any organization you work in. 
Although, I loved auditing, I was curious about how information security works, and this picked my interest. I wanted to be able to perform vulnerability and penetration tests, configure and manage firewalls, document policies and create awareness about information security in my organization. I wanted to be a subject matter expert in auditing and security, this desire attracted me to information security.
2. How has your first few years in IS GRC been for you?
My first few years has been a learning curve. There are so many things to learn and so little time. Although there were some technical contents that I had difficulty understanding, I spent time after work studying these topics to build my knowledge and skillset. I signed up with a paid plan on platforms like Cybary that offers free courses. The paid plan has more labs and courses I will have access to.
3. What would you wish someone had told you before going into this field?
You need to understand technical concepts and also how to code or write scripts. There is no running away from it.  Understanding the basics of networking makes it easier for you. 
Secondly, you might be the only female on your team, so be confident, assertive and bold to communicate what you know.
You need to connect with individuals who are in this field, people who are have experience so you can learn. You never stop learning, as long as attackers and cyber criminals are out there, you have to be ahead of them in the game.
4. What would be an important piece of advice for someone who is considering going into your career path?
Be open to learning, be confident, have a mentor or someone you look up to, connect with groups of people interested in what you do. Be a good communicator.
Have a professional development plan, give yourself goals to achieve, work hard to achieve such goals and give yourself a treat when you do so, because you deserve it.
5. What advice would you give someone to do prior to getting a job in this field?
Do a research on the role you are going for, and the role you want to be in the next 3 years, build your skillset on the skills required to occupy such roles. Be ready to train yourself, you don’t have to wait for your organization or anyone to train you.
6. Do you have a mentor?
No, I do not, but I have people I look up to. People who motivate in this field. People like Rotimi, Sophie, Simi, Kess, Lilian and a couple of other people.
