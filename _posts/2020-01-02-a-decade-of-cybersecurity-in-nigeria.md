The way we talked about Cybersecurity in this decade was like never before. One cannot write about a decade of Cybersecurity in Nigeria without revisiting some of the major events in the years before this decade, which set the ball rolling for this decade. Did we improve?

Let's go through the ride togetherðŸ˜Š

In preparation for the Decade (Before 2009)

Talking about the years before 2009 in Nigeria, we can revisit some major events that made it more important for the country to buckle up her belt in the area of cyber-security in the decade that is about to come which is **2009-2019**.

In the years before 2009, there was a time our telecommunication density as a nation was nothing to write home about. We did not have mobile phones in our hands, and the government made some decisions on how to improve this situation, a journey that was kick-started in 2001. A step that improved communication and businesses became interconnected within the country.

Just this same time, [NITDA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Information_Technology_Development_Agency) was birthed with the sole responsibility of developing a program that caters to the running of Information Communication Technology (ICT) related activities in the country. A bill was passed into law (**NITDA Act 2007**) to officially enact this power and responsibility six years after its birth. This was a move to creating an enabling environment for the implementation of ICT across the board (private and public sectors) and digitization of many manual processes of doing things in government.

[Galaxy Backbone](https://galaxybackbone.com.ng/) commenced operation in 2006 as the information technology and shared services provider of the Federal Government of Nigeria. **Galaxy Backbone** plays a key role in the development and deployment of technology initiatives and services in government, working with the master plan for e-Government in Nigeria which is to be achieved by the year **2020**.

Around this period, [NIMC](https://www.nimc.gov.ng/) was establishe9d to create, operate and manage Nigeria's national identity card database, integrate the existing identity database in government institutions, register individuals and legal residents, assign a unique National Identification Number(NIN) and introduce general multi-purpose cards. This was a sign that the country has started collecting **data** in digital forms.

**Cybercafe** business became a lucrative business as many Computer Center now provides Internet access to young teeming Nigerians in remote towns and cities. This opportunity to access the world from a small screen gave the youth that will dominate the coming decade the opportunity to learn.

But at the time no one is certain of what they were learning. Some of them started blogging, some started exploring ICT skills such as networking, programming, and web development. The leverage on social media platforms connected many to a greater sense of exposure.

[Census](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Nigerian_states_by_population) took place and the country could ascertain it's population - A teeming population of 140 million, which was a big sign for opportunities to be exploited for businesses.


> "Banks will play a major role in the decade that was about to come in 2009 especially in the area of cybersecurity and information security in general. But many events happened in the years before, which really helped to prepare them for the challenges ahead. The first of these challenges was the banking reform conducted by the CBN in 2004. The weak banks could not continue while some got saved after going through a merger. This process gave us strong banks that were ready to compete with their international counterparts."
