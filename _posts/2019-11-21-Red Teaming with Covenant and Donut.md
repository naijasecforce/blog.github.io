## Overview
Red Teaming has rapidly transitioned from Living off the Land (LotL) to Bringing Your Own Land (BYOL). 
It is now possible to execute .NET assemblies entirely within memory. By developing custom C#-based assemblies, 
attackers no longer need to rely on the tools present on the target system; they can instead write and deliver 
their own tools, a technique called Bring Your Own Land (BYOL).  This has led to transitions from PowerShell tools 
(e.g. PowerShell Empire) to frameworks targeted for .NET assemblies. {shamelessly copied from
