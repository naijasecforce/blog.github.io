### What attracted you to this career path
I already had interest in cyber security during my early IT days when an IT friend of mine wanted to download an ad song ASA did for a financial institution but it was protected. After a week or so he was able to bypass the website protection and download it, he was so excited and I was determined in knowing how. That interest over the years took me unto critical infrastructures from learning about Stuxnet (Ralph Lagner Video - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CS01Hmjv1pQ) during my graduate degree days to pondering on how can i reload my NEPA post-paid meter card without paying (stopped my research on this) and also clone physical RFID cards.

### Was there something you wish you knew when you started?
I just wish I knew how to google *how to be an hacker* during my first year university days rather than facebooking. Majority of everything I know I learnt and unlearnt through research and practice.  I believe once the curiosity and will sets in then you will learn as it is a continuous path, hence the important thing will be having the curiosity early so you can start to learn early.

### What would be an important piece of advice for someone who is considering going into your career path?
Be ready to learn and unlearn and due to the way the industry changes I advise one not to get discouraged when you encounter difficulties in understanding or executing task and to take breaks days, week or even months so you don’t get burnt out.

### Do you have a mentor? How important is it to have a mentor in the Infosec field?
I won’t say I have a mentor because then he or she would be aware, but I do have people I respect and follow this allows me to keep learning and improving.

### What is the most underrated skill someone needs to have to excel in this path?
Soft skill I’lI would say be resourceful - You can't learn everything but when you know what you want to do then you know that you have to learn a & b to achieve c or else you find yourself learning a -z of which you might never use some in your lifetime (good ethical hackers or info sec personnel do this, they have to be resourceful in achieving a goal)

Technically I would say learn the basics windows systems, network, web programming at the end of the day you are trying to help secure this asset for your client or organization.

### How do I continuously keep yourself updated?
* Same old way - keep learning and unlearning, draw up my plan on what I want to improve on this year. 
* Perform my research on blogs, courses and leaders to learn from, 
* Conduct research and also perform engagements which gives me practical experience (practical experience is very important) you  don’t want to be that student who can cram Comptia A+ book but doesn’t know how to remove a computer hard disk.

### What professional course would you advice? 
* Learn Basics (CCNA, Windows, PLCS's https://www.youtube.com/user/ParsicAutomatio). You don’t need to get a degree in engineering / process automation but have an understanding of industrial systems and how they work.
* OSCP (This helps to improves your offensive mindset on how to find weaknesses so you can better learn to protect them)
* GICSP (This helps to bridge the Cyber Security Mindset with Industrial Control Systems inner workings)
* CISSP (This might be overrated/underrated by seasoned experts but it still does well in ensuring you have a grasp of cyber security on a large scale - The What, Why and How)

### Do you have any regrets so far?
Again not being exposed early as far as back as year 2000 :) what you know limits you if you have never heard of cyber security then there is no way you are going to wake up and start a research on it. When you read the book – Outliers, you would see how early exposure really helps you also remember responsibilities and priorities change as you age.

### What attracted you to ICS/SCADA Systems?
I’ve always known there was more to cyber security. I’ve always known there was a part of cyber security that impacted safety hence, life and humanity. My first interaction with control systems was in Nigeria when I carried out a cyber security assessment for a power company and gained access to some control systems. My team and I knew we had hit something big, but we just didn’t know what it was exactly, so we moved on from it. When I got home that day, I read about cyber security for power generating systems and then I stumbled on the concept of control systems, the implementation across critical systems such as mining, transport and rail systems, water management, power generation and other related systems. When I read all this, it immediately got my attention and interest.

There was also the second factor of time and chance. I was fortunate to be in a country, and work with for a firm with a solid expertise in cyber security for control systems. This also increased my exposure and knowledge.

### Was there something you wish you knew when you started?
With the benefit of hindsight, I wish I had a deeper knowledge of the *real/practical* (not just book definitions) differences in IT systems and Control Systems. Core difference being IT systems are not mission critical, and an outage has little or no impact on safety/human life. In plain terms, if someone implements cyber security controls on critical systems without a proper knowledge of the environment, it could be fatal. Therefore, with critical systems, a thorough understanding of the systems, the people operating the systems and finally the vendor is critical to cybersecurity. While security is important, safety always comes first.

### What would be an important piece of advice for someone who is considering going into your career path?
* Relationship building. The success of any cyber security program in a control systems environment is highly dependent on a good working relationship between the cyber security team, field operators, and engineers. Seek to understand the field engineers, operators and their concerns and be ready to sell your cyber security program as an enhancement to the control systems. Your cyber security program must support field operations and not hinder it.
* Be able to differentiate between a disturbance/hindrance and an actual safety issue. A good friend pointed this out to me when she told me that some field engineers take their systems very personally, so a change in their routine (e.g. disable USBs) would be a hindrance/disturbance (if they use USBs for daily backups), and they may paint it as a possible safety issue (unable to recover control systems backups in the event of a corrupt system). This is not because they are dishonest, they just don’t know the impact of your changes and why change a process when it is not broken? You must be able to identify these grey areas and be ready to proffer solutions.

* You must also understand the costs associated with the solution you are providing. Most field sites are miles away from cities and towns, with the control systems (hopefully) not connected to the internet and with strict vendor agreements and warranties. So, when you request something as simple as: the anti-malware solution be implemented and updated *monthly*. The singular cost of this control may run into thousands of dollars because this will require the control system vendor travelling out every month to a remote field site to install anti-malware updates. When you factor in travel costs, accommodation, vendor hourly charge and other costs, you may want to consider alternate controls to prevent malware access such as locking down USB and the use of other portable devices, proper network segmentation to ensure traffic is contained and controlled before you schedule anti-malware updates to a time frame as the budget deems fit.

* Finally, you must know what you are doing. Engineers are smart people – they literally keep the world safe. You must keep your knowledge up to date, read blogs, read papers, attend conferences etc.
 
### Do you have a mentor? How important is it to have a mentor in the Infosec field?
I have multiple mentors in the Info Sec field, and every day the mentor list gets longer. Due to the changing nature of the info sec field, you will need multiple mentors. Be ready to reach out, connect build relationships and keep learning. 

### What’s the most underrated skill someone needs to have to excel in this path?
Relationship building, because you may get to a field site and the engineer is more concerned about international politics and global economics. you must be ready to connect with him/her on that to get your job going.

### How do you continuously keep yourself updated?
I read anything and everything!!! I read vendor blogs, I read technology blogs, I keep up with CERT sites, I have a column on Tweetdeck dedicated to #security and #icssecurity. I also read broad issues across health, family, social welfare, politics. this helps me connect to my clients on various fronts.

### What professional courses would you advice?
Cyber security is wide so you must choose your area of specialization and delve in. A good starting point is CISSP, which presents cyber security as domains and helps you gain an understanding of what cyber security is. Once that is completed, you can then proceed with certifications in any area of interest.

### Do you have any regrets so far?
Sincerely, none. But looking to secure a Nuclear plant, and a space mission project, I hope I survive it.
