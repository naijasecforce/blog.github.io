## Time Frame
Q4, 2019 till date (9/12/2019)

## Overview
Starting from late November, 2019 till now (9th December, 2019), the NaijaSecForce team detected a surge in Emotet spam campaign targeting corporate mailboxes within Africa and Globally.
Emotet is not new as it was first recorded in 2014. Emotet is an extremely sophisticated and destructive banking Trojan used to download and install other malware. 
So what makes Emotet virus so dangerous? According to an article by AppAnyRun, Emotet can act like a worm and spread using local networks, which makes it extremely hard to clean-up. In addition to this, the Trojan has advanced persistence and anti-evasion mechanics, such as the ability to detect sandboxes and virtual machines with an option to generate false indicators to throw researches off. On top of that, the Trojan has a polymorphic design – meaning that it can change its code to bypass signature-based detection, making this cyber defense strategy useless against its’ attacks.
Today Emotet is targeting governments, corporations, small businesses and individuals, focusing on Africa, Europe and America.
