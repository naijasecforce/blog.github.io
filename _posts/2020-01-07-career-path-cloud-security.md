### What attracted you to this career path?
Honestly, it was the Movie 24. Sounds funny right? The character Chloe fascinated me on how she was able to trace things happening on the systems.  I have always believed that the human mind is the origin of Innovation - If It Can Think It, then it can be done.  
I was curious to understand how systems integrate and how people could communicate with each other from different countries.

### How has your first few years in cloud security been for you?
Awesome, mind blowing, engaging and busy. Knowing that as we gear towards technology and move away from physical datacenters to cloud services, one must ensure that the right configuration, policies and procedures are in place to prevent us from exposure.
It is constantly a daily routine learning on how to be secured with cloud services and implementing this on the infrastructures that are placed in my care.

### What would you wish someone had told you before going into this field?
Absolutely nothing. I delved into technology working with a good institution and so I learnt a lot.

### What would be an important piece of advice for someone who is considering going into your career path?
Nothing is static in this field. Continuous reading, research, self-improvement and quest for information is what is required to stand you out.

### What advise would you give to someone  prior to getting a job in this field?
Get basic computer networking and security knowledge it would help put things into perspectives. I would recommend the CompTIA Security + and CompTIA N+ course. If you are a fresh graduate, try to take up internship jobs in this field to give you good background. Learn one scripting skills e.g. Python, It is good for automating your processes.

### Do you have a mentor?
Yes, Ikenna Nwafor and Ike Williams these men have helped shaped my career into what it is today and where it is going to. I also have people who have been awesome tools in this Journey Daniel Onwude, Michael Ogunlade, Victor Okpara (my first Boss), Adeniyi Ademosu, Fatumata Soukouna-Coker, Babatola Oresajo
